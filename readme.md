# WP Mail Customizations

Applies customizations to WordPress's mail settings and output.

## Features

* Changes default "From" name and email address
* Customizes email message text on password and email change emails.

## DO NOT USE AS-IS!

This is not a user plugin. It's designed to be implemented by a developer and the code must be customized on a per-site basis. Perhaps some day we'll add a settings page.
